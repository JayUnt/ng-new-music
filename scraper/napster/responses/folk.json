The majority of these String Bands were just local players from towns scattered across the southeastern United States. They'd initially come to local prominence by playing community dances or parties. As Hillbilly music caught on, record companies started searching for rural music to record, and many musicians earned greater fame and began touring farther and farther from home. Some, like <a href=\"http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-skillet-lickers\">Gid Tanner's Skillet Lickers</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/charlie-poole\">Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers</a>, gained strong followings until 1929, when the Great Depression halted the careers of most of these musicians.",

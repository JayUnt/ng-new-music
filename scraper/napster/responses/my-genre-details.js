    description: "There's no question that purveyors of modern power pop are constantly looking over their shoulders to the sugared sounds of '70s and '80s acts like Big Star, Cheap Trick and Badfinger. But the principals of the sound have remained the same throughout the decades: big backbeats, sweet melodies, catchy hooks and clever lyrical turns. No one embodies these better than Matthew Sweet, whose <i>Girlfriend</i> set a high bar with its deliriously catchy tunes when it came out in 1991, but the optimistic '90s saw a crop of acts like Jellyfish, the Cardigans and Weezer deliver sunny, broadly influential examples of the genre. In recent years, Fountains of Wayne have carried the torch with moderate commercial success, and the lines between power pop and pop punk have become hazy. A crop of popular independent acts like Brendan Benson, 
Ted Leo and Spoon, however, have bounced along just below the radar.",

    description: `Pop is a catch-all term that's taken on myriad meanings over the years. In its nascent days, "pop" applied to commercially successful artists who won broad public interest with lighthearted fare. As the 20th century progressed, popular music gravitated to a particular sound: three minutes of bright melodies & infectious hooks. Today, pop music continues to swerve back and forth between these two aspects of its definition. Because the term essentially refers to music composed for popular appeal, the aesthetics of pop vary almost constantly according to the tastes of the time: doo-wop, disco and electronic dance music have all been pop. At the same time, artists in very un-mainstream genres (like indie rock and electronic music) often play or at least play with that quintessential pop style of bright melodies and infectious hooks. This is the place for the music that people have heard on the radio and blasted out car windows across the decades -

More than a musical revolution, Punk was a full-blown assault on the soured, restrictive social and political conventions that lingered in England following World War II. Few people were living England's 'dream' lifestyle of economic security, sophistication, and modernity, allowing bands such as <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-sex-pistols">the Sex Pistols</a> -- Punk's standard bearers -- burst onto the scene. Taking their cue from the New York groups, the Sex Pistols' anger and rebelliousness permeated their music, their appearance, their stage presence, and the embittered politics of their lyrics.

Nirvana's Punk roots were meanwhile so distinct that the Grunge music they defined can be considered a flavor of Punk.
